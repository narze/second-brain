- Replace https://github.com/narze/og-image-asq which is using old version of https://github.com/vercel/og-image (Puppeteer) to generate image
- Will use `@vercel/og` on NextJS app folder (The app routes includes `@vercel/og` out of the box)
- Found error [`Invalid <Link> with <a> child`](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-new-link-with-extra-anchor)
    - Fix with codemod
    ```sh
    npx @next/codemod new-link .
    ```
- Faster to debug on Vercel's playground https://og-playground.vercel.app
- Issues from the library (not sure @vercel/og or @vercel/satori)
    - Viewport sizes `vw`, `vh` does not work
    - Weird Thai word breaking
    - ปัญหาวรรณยุกต์จม (สลิ่ม -> สลีม) ![](1-Projects/100DaysOfCode-R3/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230605225659.png)
- Try to modify `getEntries` to use local file 
    - [Assets import](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/urlImports#asset-imports) not working
    - Maybe using prebuild script should work? https://kontent.ai/blog/how-to-run-scripts-before-every-build-on-next-js/
        - Should use something similar to generating sitemap at build time https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-generate-a-sitemap-for-my-nextjs-app-on-vercel 
            - Modify next.config.js https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-sitemap/next.config.js
