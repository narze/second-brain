- https://github.com/narze/tmptation - file.io alternative
- Tried [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com)
    - It wraps S3 to make upload easier
    - By the way it does not fit my needs, I need temporary file uploading like https://file.io
        - It also lets use upload file from the browser
    - Now uploadthing does not have delete API, need to delete only from its dashboard https://uploadthing.com/dashboard
- Tried Cloudflare R2
    - Use compatiple AWS S3 sdk js https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/examples/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3
    - Use NextJS 13 app route handler
    - Struggled on using [Formidable](https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable) to parse the file upload from curl command `curl -F "file=@.gitignore" "http://localhost:3000/api/upload"`
        - Also with Busboy
        - Maybe I have to parse ReadableStream myself...
            - No... try `request.formData()` tomorrow https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/formData

            - [ ] Also you can access `/tmp` on Serverless Function, maybe S3 Is not even needed https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-use-files-in-serverless-functions#using-temporary-storage
