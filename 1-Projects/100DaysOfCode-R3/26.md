Fix tests failing in ChatOS
- Dexie / IndexedDb does not work with Playwright https://dexie.org/docs/DexieErrors/Dexie.MissingAPIError
    - In fact, we don't want to read in-browser indexeddb  from playwright tests that is not in the browser, so we adjust the tests to delay a bit before reading chat logs
