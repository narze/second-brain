# First Flipper Zero App
- Followed this tutorial https://flipper.atmanos.com/docs/your-first-program/intro
    - It turns out that this is outdated, luckily there is an [open PR with working code](https://github.com/at-manos/flipper-swdocs/pulls) -> https://deploy-preview-4--mellifluous-heliotrope-52ca01.netlify.app
- Clone code
```shell
git clone --recursive https://www.github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git
```
- Run [`fbt`](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/fbt.md) to compile
```shell
# See all commands
./fbt -h

# Compile .dfu in /dist, then use qFlipper to flash firmware
./fbt

# Compile & flash firmware from fbt
./fbt flash_usb
# or
./fbt flash_usb_full

# Build only FAPs
./fbt fap_dist

# Build specific app
./fbt fap_{APPID} # e.g. fap_badusb
# Build & run
./fbt fap_{APPID} launch_app APPSRC={APPID}
```

## Development steps (as of my knowledge - May 6, 2023)
- Connect Flipper Zero through USB
- Close qFlipper (fbt won't work if qFlipper is connected to Flipper)
- `./fbt fap_yourapp launch fap_yourapp`
- Open qFlipper
