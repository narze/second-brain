ChatOS
- Add local message persistence (localstorage / indexedDB)
- Choose IndexedDB since localstorage supports only string, but we would store something more than JSON
- IndexedDB wrapper libraries
    - Dexie
    - PouchDB
    - idb
    - localforage
    - jsstore
- Chose [Dexie](https://dexie.org) since it looks good & have [svelte support](https://dexie.org/docs/Tutorial/Svelte)
- Now the message is persisted in local machine ![](1-Projects/100DaysOfCode-R3/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230529004623.png)
