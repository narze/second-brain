- Add overlay type `YOUTUBE_LIVE_CHAT`
```
enum OverlayType {
  SLIDES
  YOUTUBE_LIVE_CHAT
}
```
- Problems
    - Trying to extract Prisma enums into zod as schema & `<select>` but don't know how... will fix later
    - No easy way to validate JSON type from client side, now have to type cast string into `Record<string, any>` and parse json before calling mutation
    - Should change metadata field from textarea to JSON editor with automated validation ![](1-Projects/100DaysOfCode-R3/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230503000908.png)
