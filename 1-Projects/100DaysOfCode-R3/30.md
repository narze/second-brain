    - Error: `ReferenceError: require is not defined` from `resvg-js`
- [svelte-component-to-image](https://github.com/StephenGunn/svelte-component-to-image)
    - Has problems with Tailwind class
        - aspect-square
        - z-index
        - image (Must use `fetch` or full url)
        - Cannot render svg at all
- [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori)
    - Same problems with svelte-component-to-image
    - Svg `Error: <text> nodes are not currently supported, please convert them to <path>
    - Tailwind must use `tw=` instead of `class=` attribute key
- Workarounds
    - Use separate set of code (render on web, render og image only)
    - svg -> black png with css filter `hex-to-css-filter`
- Share button
    - `?c=aabbcc&t=text`
    - Cannot send url with `&` to share in twitter, so that only 1 key can be sent
    - Use [`base64util`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/base64util) to encode and combine into single query string key
