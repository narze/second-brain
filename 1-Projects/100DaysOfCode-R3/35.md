- Opentype.js
    - The one used by Satori is a fork [@shuding/opentype.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shuding/opentype.js)
- Test Satori with another font on google fonts (IBM Plex Sans Thai) and another from f0nt.com, does not work
- Change back to original `opentype.js` does not work
- Create a simple Svelte app and use opentype.js, it does the same
    - But on https://opentype.js.org it renders correctly ![](1-Projects/100DaysOfCode-R3/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230609233123.png)
    - Turns out that version 1.3.4 is from year 2021 but there are Thai fixes recently ![](1-Projects/100DaysOfCode-R3/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230609235224.png)
    - ![](1-Projects/100DaysOfCode-R3/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230610002107.png)
    - only the first link works (should be the latest version) `https://opentype.js.org/dist/opentype.js`
- Question is, can I use the latest opentype within Satori & @vercel/og ?
    - Maybe no :( ![](1-Projects/100DaysOfCode-R3/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230610002317.png)
- Maybe build a simple one for my use?
