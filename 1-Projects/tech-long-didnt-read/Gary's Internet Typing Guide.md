How to touch type
- Keybr.com for starters, then Monkeytype.com
- Practice 8 fingers typing
- Never look keyboard (especially on 26 letters, spacebar, backspace)

Understanding the role of repetition
- Develop muscle memory for many words as possible
- 15min/day * 365 != 2hr/day * 45
- Don't overdo it
- Rest, sleep is important, typing improvement happens while you sleep, too

Use English 1k (Monkeytype) to improve your typing
- Standard is only 200 top English words, not enough
- Go from 1k -> 5k -> 10k
- Develop strong muscle memory for bigrams (e.g. about -> ab+bo+ou+ut)

Accuracy
- Becoming really accurate takes time
- Get "reliably repeatable accuracy"
- Type at a slightly slower speed
- Repeat practicing words that you regularly make mistakes, and slow down
- Stop quitting so many tests

Reading Ahead
- Reading ahead eliminates pauses between words
- Do it after having good muscle memory

Duration & Frequency
- Improvement happens when you sleep at night (Brain)
- There will be a point of diminishing returns

Impressive typing
- Use any word list other than default 200-300 word list
- Test duration >= 1 minute
- Accuracy > 98%
- Correct mistakes (ctrl-backspace)
- Ignore "raw speed"
