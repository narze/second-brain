## Summary
- The answer for many developers: Chase shiny objects
- Imagine you have "Innovation Tokens" to use for building new things, and you have 3 tokens to use. With limited resources it will make less sense to innovate within new databases or new programming paradigms (NodeJS, MongoDB at that point of time) instead of the features or company missions.
- On new, shiny technologies there will be more "Unknown Unknowns" than the old, boring technology.
- When choosing new tech (like db), make sure that the short-term benefits exceeds than the long-term costs of operating it. But most of the time, it doesn't.
- Make a mapping between problems and technologies to solve them, using same technology to solve more than one problem will reduce the cost while retaining same benefit.
- From the cost function: `total_cost = sum(maintenance_cost) - sum(velocity_benefit)`. If cost per tech is cheap, you can use many different techs. If each tech is expensive, pick few techs and share more problems per tech.
- In reality, new tech choices are expensive and dominate the maintenance cost, since operating tech on production is hard, there are many things to worry about for setting up & maintaining new tech on production.
- When to use exciting new tech
  - Communicate more, ask how you would solve the problem with the existing stack
  - Find low-risk ways to get started
  - Commit to removing the old, redundant system
- Use proven tech, choose a few globally optimal tech, master the tech, ship stuff
- Worry about the big picture (the product) more than the database to pick
