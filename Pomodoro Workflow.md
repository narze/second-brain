title: "Pomodoro Workflow"

[Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is one of the productivity method I use all the time. It's easy but very effective. I use this technique whenever I'm working, both in and out of office. The current app I use for timing is [Time Out](https://www.dejal.com/timeout). There are many Pomodoro apps but I like this once since it will block my screen, forcing me to take breaks.

My ratio is 30-minute work per 6-minute break (Standard is 25:5). I tweak so I can fit 4 sessions before and after [Power Nap](https://monosor.com/how-i-sleep)

When I take breaks I'll do things to keep my mind out of work eg.

-   Walk around
-   Re-fill water bottles
-   Quick chats with co-workers
-   Toilet
-   Practice typing on [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) (You can set Time Out to load any website on breaks.)
-   Check emails on mobile phone
-   Or just close my eyes until the break is finished

The Pomodoro technique really helps me on focusing, and keeping my energy throughout the day.
