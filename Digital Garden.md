What you're reading here is not a blog, it's a "digital garden".

It consists of posts like blog, but they can grow, like plants.

All of the posts will not be sorted chronogically and paginated to be forgotten over time (that sounds sad.)

All of the posts can be updated when I have more ideas to add, some will even be tagged with work-in-progress,
like the small seeds waiting for the water & nutrition.

If you're interested in building your digital garden like mine, see [Joel Hook's post][1].

I'll keep planting more posts, so stick around!
