- NEVER LOOK AT KEYBOARD
  - Lose half to one second each time
  - Also ergonomically bad (neck, back)
- Practice every day
  - Not too much (less chant 30m/day)
  - Kata principle
- Focus on accuracy first
- Build muscle memory, change to larger wordsets when consistent or plateau to improve bigrams
  - Monkeytype: English -> English 1k -> 5k -> 10k
- Stop subvocalizing (pronuncing words or letters) while typing
  - Or change from subvocalizing letters to subvocalizing words at least
- Don't skip wrong words, alt/ctrl + bksp to correct them
- Try lookahead mode
  - Stylus script https://github.com/narze/userscripts/blob/master/userstyles/monkeytype-readahead-fadeout.user.css
- Type in words, not letters (works well with subvocalizing words)
