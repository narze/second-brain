title: "Typing Practice Drills (2020)"
---

These are my typing practice drills. I tried to do it every day, 20-30 minutes per day.

## Common words

I like typing on [10ff](https://10fastfingers.com/) it's easy to use and I can use [custom CSS](https://github.com/narze/userscripts/tree/master/userstyles#styles) to force me to look a word ahead

![10ff - Hide next word mode](https://github.com/narze/userscripts/raw/master/userstyles/10fastfingers-hidenextword.gif)

I use 2 modes for practice

-   200 words (60 seconds) [https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english)
-   200 words (10 minutes) [https://10fastfingers.com/widget/typingtest?dur=600](https://10fastfingers.com/widget/typingtest?dur=600)
    -   If I don't have time I'll skip this one

## Article - Medium.com

I like to read from medium.com, but if I type along I can get 2 birds with 1 stone. It's not fast but quite fun. Previously I will copy the text from it's article and type away in a text editor. But if I want to get typing stats I have to save it on [10ff text practice mode](https://10fastfingers.com/text-practice) or [Keyhero custom typing test](https://www.keyhero.com/custom-typing-test/)

Caveats: Medium.com will convert quotes and dashes to a beautiful one that is not the same as on your keyboard, like `“”` or `—`. I used to replace them with Keyboard Maestro script. Now I'm developing a [Chrome extension](https://github.com/narze/article-scraper-web-extension) to scrape article and convert the text for me.

It took me 10-15 minutes for 5-min read article, so 1 Medium article and around 15 minutes of common words practice I will call it a day.
