- "Communication"
- Real-time communication has overhead & sync, use sparingly
- Use Meeting as a last resort
- Distinguish Factual Context from Spatial Context
- Text message is async communication
- Urgency is overrated, ASAP is poison, don't use these words often
- Don't reply instantly, think first
- Ask for confirmation
- Automation (Slack)
  - Automatic daily at 16:30
  - Automatic weekly at Monday mornings
