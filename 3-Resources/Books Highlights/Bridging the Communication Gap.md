Describing how and what but not why left the success of the project to pure chance. — location: [473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008YZ993W&location=473) ^ref-42594

---
better results can be achieved if developers and testers also have a say in what is to be built. — location: [497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008YZ993W&location=497) ^ref-28881

Instead of handing down incomplete abstract requirements, we should focus on facilitating the flow of information and better communication between all team members. Then people can work out for themselves whether the information is complete and correct and ensure that they understand each other. — location: [558](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008YZ993W&location=558) ^ref-60247

Use real-world examples to build a shared understanding of the domain. Select a set of these examples to be a specification and an acceptance test suite. Automate verification of the acceptance tests. Focus the software development effort on the acceptance tests. Use the set of acceptance tests to facilitate discussion about future change requests, effectively going back to step 1 for a new cycle of development. — location: [654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008YZ993W&location=654) ^ref-10587

Agile acceptance testing happens before and during development and it is performed by the implementation team. — location: [737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008YZ993W&location=737) ^ref-61784

---
Agile acceptance testing is very different from user acceptance testing, and in general it is not about testing at all. It is about improving communication and building a shared understanding of the domain. — location: [771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008YZ993W&location=771) ^ref-13895
