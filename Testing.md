    - If you write code, write tests.
    - Donâ€™t get stuck on unit testing dogma.
    - Embrace unit testing karma.
    - Think of code and test as one.
    - The test is more important than the unit.
    - The best time to test is when the code is fresh.
    - Tests not run waste away.
    - An imperfect test today is better than a perfect test someday.
    - An ugly test is better than no test.
    - Sometimes, the test justifi es the means.
    - Only fools use no tools.
    - Good tests fail.
