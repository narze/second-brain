title: "The Three-Body Problem - Cixin Liu"
---

A chinese SF novel about (no-spoilers) Chinese history in time of [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution), an astrophysicist, a Virtual Reality game, and how they related to some weird phenomenon from unknown source. The book is the first book of three-book trilogy in [Remembrance of Earth's Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) which I have not read all of them yet.
