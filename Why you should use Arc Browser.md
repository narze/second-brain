- Pinned tabs can set URL, can navigate away and "Reset to pinned URL" later
- Little Arc window
- Multiple profiles in same window
- Tabs / Profiles are synced through multiple Macs
- Split view
- Group pinned tabs with folders
- Rename Pinned tabs
- Built-in mini player
- Keyboard Shortcuts
  - Switch to last accessed tab (âŒ˜+')
  - Switch profiles
  - Pin / unpin tab
  - Show / hide sidebar
- Dev Mode
- Command bar instead of url bar

Possible Improvements
- CLI command to open url with specified profile (Arc does not have cli capability like Chrome yet)
- Sync extensions across machines
- Confusing when setting shortcuts with non-qwerty layouts
