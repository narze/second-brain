I was inspired from [Fostering psychological safety with a personal user manual](https://nesslabs.com/personal-user-manual). This is the manual about how you can interact or work with me.

## Overview

-   Uptime 08:00 - 25:00 (~6.5-hour sleep on weekdays & [freerunning sleep](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freerunning_sleep) on weekends)
-   Power Nap 15:00-15:30
-   Loves problem solving
-   [ISFJ-A "Assertive Defender"](https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-conclusion) (Previously I was an INTJ like on 5 years ago)
-   Productivity enthusiast

## Strengths

-   Researching for solutions to the problem
-   Solving logical problems
-   Like finding better / alternative ways to do things
-   Brain-storming ideas
-   Observant

## Weaknesses

-   I cannot work at all when stressed out
-   Long meetings will make me out of energy for the rest of the day
-   Public speaking
-   Overly detailed

## Communication

-   Twitter, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Slack, Email
-   I prefer short & concise messages rather than the longer one with same intent.
-   If it is not personal, or will benefit the team. I will redirect it to the team channel/room.
-   Expect that I will not answer instantly, as when I'm focusing I will disable all notification channels.
