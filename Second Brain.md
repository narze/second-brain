# Second Brain
A term coined by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co). It's about capturing everything in a system to reduce information overload. He also created [PARA Method](/PARA%20Method.md).

I used most of the tips from https://www.swyx.io/obsidian-brain to setup Second Brain on [Obsidian](/Obsidian.md). However, I didn't pay for [Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md) and use [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) and Github Pages.
