title: "Relentless - Tim Grover"
---

Tim classifies people into 3 groups: Cooler, Closer, and Cleaner. Then focus on what Cleaner thinks and does to achieve successful career, like Micheal Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Dwyane Wade for instance. Alghouth I don't know much of NBA or basketball words like "Ring", or "Game Four" to it confuses me a little bit. Overall this book inspired me to improve myself and be a Cleaner one day.
