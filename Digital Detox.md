title: "Digital Detox"
---

Every once in a while, I slipped into the world full of distractions, named the Internet. Like everyone does, I take hours viewing Youtube videos, scroll through Facebook posts, reading Tweets, and so on. All of them are neatly optimized that you'll keep checking them out, again and again.

I stumbled upon this idea by [Andrew Kirby's Dopamine Detox][1] (Yeah, on his Youtube). The rule sounds easy but really hard to do. That is, don't do anything that gives you Dopamine. Which in the extreme level, includes eating as well. I tried it once and it works like a charm. But I have to admit that it is difficult since I still have to eat, feed dogs, write blogs. So I make a subset of Dopamine Detox. It's called Digital Detox.

The rule is more simple, of course. Just don't touch or use anything which distracts you digitally. I tried to do it twice a month, in the weekends. 

## My detoxification day
Before the day, I would prepare myself to reduce external factors and temptation to use my smartphone or computer.

- Prepare a book to read, e-book reader is OK but make sure you have the book file and disable the network afterward.
- Disable or mute all app notifications. I made an exception for the alarm clock app though.
- Tell your friends or family that you'll be unavailable for a day.

Then on the day after I put of the alarm. I leave my phone there and continue the day without it. Read the book you want to, write articles (I have a disconnected Macbook Air for this), meditate, play with my dogs, do chores.

## Reflection
The Digital Detox helps me getting back on track. Sometimes I spent many hours a day watching Youtube and getting less sleep, and it affected the other day. Furthermore, it helps me focus more on doing things. I can read more than my other days as I tend to stop after a few pages. Lastly, I can feel the Dopamine rush when I can finally check the unread messages in the end of the day.
