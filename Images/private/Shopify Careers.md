- Interviews
  - https://prepfully.com/practice-interviews
  - Experiences
    - code challenge, life story interview, pair programming (2x), technical deep dive
    - Straight to coding
    - initial screening with short live coding, life story interview
    - Past projects story telling
    - Virtual onsite which consists of 2 pair programming and one technical deep dive session.
    - Usual Shopify interview - 1 code screening - 1 life story - 1 design - 2 code pairing
    - Programming problem administered in a language of my choice via [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io). I chose Ruby, which probably got me bonus points (but definitely choose your strongest language if it's not Ruby). I chose to use TDD during all my coding interviews, which probably helped impress them.
    - The overall expectation is quite high and you are supposed to think about TDD and perform clean code following SOLID principles in both of the pair programming rounds.
    - Don't forget to tell them in detail why are you making each class and method. I tried to explain while coding but in the feedback, I was not vocal enough.
    - At the end you will get feedback (for each of these sessions) which clarifies why you do not get an offer.
  - Questions
    - Why Shopify?
    - A popcorn costs $7 soda cost $2.5 when bought together they cost $9. Given an input list of dates and the name of the items bought, find the total amount spent. All pairs of soda and popcorn should be treated as a bundle if they were bought on the same date, even if they are not bought one after the other.
    - Are you a good fit for our company & mission?
    - Like tell me about a timeâ€¦ kind of questions.
    - Describe design approach to particular problem (they expect to take into account Shopify's scale) 
    - Life-story questions (describe your experience so far - it was very vague and I'm not sure what they are looking for there)
    - System design interview with a focus on architectural knowledge.
    - write a method to return inventory names which can provide an order
    - Regular coding questions, [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) level from easy to medium
    - Write a console app: given some locations with the certain amount of certain goods, list all of them that can fulfill the order of products of certain amount.
    - Life story round: How did you get into Software Engineering? What did you study at university/school? What prompted you to pursue this? I was also asked about my earlier years, i.e. what was it like growing up etc. Don't be offended by this, it's not necessarily them trying to probe you, more like a "white glove service" thing. If you would not like to talk about it, talk about something else and quickly skip over this.
  - Challenges
    - Design a robot that travels on a 2d space
    - Gilded rose refactoring
    - Building a CLI tool for google's mars rover challenge
    - Build a shopping cart with discounts
    - Given different fruits with different rules for discounts, calculate how much it would cost
    - It was a simple problem in javascript where you had to output a a shopping cart with fruit and their price with discounts where applicable.
    - You get a link to a Google Doc with a design and a list of requirements. You need to create that in any language you want.
    - Given this sorted string list. Write a code that will split and sort it using specific rules.
    - Build a product checkout with different pricing scenarios
    - To perform search in an array.
    - design a Shopify app extension
    - Adding some complexity to the initial problem after completing the code
