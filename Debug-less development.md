# Debug-less Development

Are you using `console.log` all the time when you create websites?

Are you adding breakpoints in every if-else blocks in IDE?

I saw some people tried to print everything all the time they write code. I think these behaviors are not making them be better developers, but worse.

## Why?
- It slows you down
- It leaks data
- It makes code dirty
- It lowers your trust in your code

## What can I do instead?
- Write tests instead
- Write better & cleaner code
- Make printing logs your last resort
- Use debugging tools to "debug"
