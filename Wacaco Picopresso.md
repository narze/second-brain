- Basket size is 52.5mm-
- Can use Staresso SP-300 Tamper & Basket
- If you are not sure about grind size, go coarser first, too fine coffee grounds will make the high pressure and will make the portafilter stuck and also do some damage to the piston [causing leaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiLVYEMfyuo)
