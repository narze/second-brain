title: "How I Sleep"
---

I am a sleepy person, on weekends I sleep for 9-12 hours. Though my deep sleep rate is more than average (30% of sleeping time). But on work days I certainly cannot sleep that much.

I tried many techniques to decrease my long sleep time. The methods are not as different as what other people say about how to improve sleep quality.

-   No caffeine afternoon
-   No alcohol
-   No food at night
-   No screen time 2 hours before sleep (This one I can't...)
-   Exercise regularly
-   Sleep & wake at the same time, every day

All of these works OK, but there's one thing that really helps me to sleep only 6-7 hours a day. It is the Power Nap.

## Power Nap

Every work day I will to go office's couch at the same time (3PM for me). Then I'll set my smart watch alarm, cover my eyes, and sleep. The Power Nap time may vary from 15-30 minutes. I experimented and found that 25 minutes work best for me. This helps me "reset" the energy level and work more efficiently until the day ends.

However, I have to make sure that I don't nap more than 30 minutes, or I will be so groggy after I wake up.

Furthermore, I will finish my coffee first, to make the nap be the [Coffee Nap](https://www.sleepadvisor.org/coffee-nap). The caffeine will kick in just the time I wake up, and make the nap more effective.
