title: "Personal OKRs"
---

New year's resolutions are not working for me. I used to set goals every year, and then I quit doing them within 2-3 months. It was not just I'm lazy, but when a month has passed, some of the goals I set became unnecessary or unrelevant, or I got bored and changed my mind from some of the goals I previously want to achieve. Moreover, I don't want to wait 3-6 months to start doing something on the new year's date. So I adopt [OKRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) and set new goals every 3 months instead. I currently use [Weekdone](https://weekdone.com/) to track my personal OKRs and update it every other day. I will have only 3 objectives per quarter so they won't be too much, each objective will have 3-5 Key Results which are not too easy but achieveable.

Here are some of my OKRs

-   Improve myself as a better frontend developer
    
    -   Finish #100DaysOfCode with no more than 10 days skip
    -   Create 10 websites & deploy to cloud
    -   Create 3 working open source projects which have 10 Github Stars each
    -   Learn 8 testing javascript courses
-   Get good at reading
    
    -   Read 10 books
    -   Write 10 articles about books I read
-   Be a better writer/blogger
    
    -   Write 50 articles/posts
    -   Setup email subscription & get 50 subscribers
