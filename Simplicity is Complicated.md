title: "Simplicity is Complicated"
---

I've heard people say that they want to make something like "Social network for X", "WhatsApp, but for Y", or "Blockchain to solve Z".

When I ask why, some answered "Because [competitor product name] is hard to use, but what I build will be more user-friendly, and easy to use."

"Wow, then how would you _do_ it?"

"Just make the simpler version of it."

"How?"

"Hire a team to focus on UX/UI."

"I think [competitor product name] already have the team, with supposedly more people than yours."

"Yeah, but we can make it _better_ than them."

The conversation did not end well.

What they think about their product is based on nothing but the goal they want to see.

I can do nothing but to wish them good luck, and learn how to achieve "Simplicity" the hard way.
