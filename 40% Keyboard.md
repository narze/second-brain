title: "40% Keyboard"
---

Some people has seen me using [Planck Keyboard](https://olkb.com/collections/planck). In fact, I've 3 of them. The keyboard form factor is called "40%" which has only 4 rows and does not have function row or number row. To type them you'll need more modifier keys to trigger the additional layers. They're called `Lower` & `Raise` layers. When you press `Lower` modifier key with `Q` you'll get `!`, and `Raise + Q` you'll get `1`, for instance. They need more keystrokes but less finger travel.

The first Planck I had was the Rev. 3, which is also the first custom mechanical keyboard I had built. Apart from the bizarre and hard-to-master layout, I found that it was using [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/), the most powerful keyboard firmware which you can customize & program the firmware however you like using code.

I've built the [SuperDuper Mode](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/users/narze/superduper.c) which was heavily inspired from [this](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/blob/05ca98733f3e3501e0679814c3795d1cb57e177f/src/core/server/Resources/include/checkbox/simultaneouskeypresses_vi_mode.xml#L4-L10) and [this](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard#super-duper-mode). The idea is I can ditch all the arrow keys and use only keys on the home row for movements in all directions. It was the time when the old version of [Karabiner](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner) is not yet compatible with simultaneous keypress in macOS Sierra, so I have to move my SD mode to physical keyboard like the Planck.

I saw someone stated that 40% keyboards are the [Dark Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls) of keyboards. It takes time to learn to use, but once you've mastered it, then you can use all types of keyboards easily.
