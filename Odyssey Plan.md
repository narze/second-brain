title: "Odyssey Plan"
---

Odyssey Plan is a tool to help visualizing and designing your life in the next 5-10 years. You might have been asked about what will you be in the next 5 years. But doing the Odyssey Plan will open up the alternative possibilities in your life.

In short, write or draw out these 3 scenarios:

1.  The current 5-year plan. Year by year.
2.  If the first plan can't happen. What will you do instead?
3.  If you don't have to think about time and money at all. What will you do?
