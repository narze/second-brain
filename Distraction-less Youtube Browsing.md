# Goals
- View only videos you want to see
- Bookmarks are easy to add from mobile and/or web Youtube
- Binge watch without being side-tracked to video recommendations
- Able to use Youtube Premium (No Ads)

# Solutions
- Unhook.app chrome extension to hide distractions and use mobile youtube.com (Android: use Kiwi browser)
- Use youtube's [`Watch Later`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL) playlist, since it has a feature to remove watched videos from the playlist
