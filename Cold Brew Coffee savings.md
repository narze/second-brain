title: "Cold Brew Coffee savings"
---

I forget the exact number all the time, so I'll put it here.

Coffee beans (250g) : 120 THB / bag 1 bag of coffee can do around 3 batches of cold brew 1 batch of cold brew = 4 shots of coffee (no milk) so it will be 10 THB / cup

Water : Around 3 THB / Litre < 0.5 THB / cup so I'll skip this

2 litres of milk (Meiji) : 90 THB 1 cup uses 250ml so around 12 THB / cup

1 bottle of vanilla syrup : 300 THB I don't know exactly how many cups it can make, but the whole bottle takes around a month, so it is 5 THB / cup

Typical coffee (Amazon) : 60 THB / cup

Saving 60 - (10 + 12 + 5) = 27 THB / CUP

Me & my wife drink 1 cup per day -> 60 cups per month

To summarize, we saved 27 * 60 = 1620 THB per month!
